## Current Version
The current official version of GBFS is [v2.2](reference).  

!!! note

    This version is limited in its support for carsharing. Significant additions were made to the specification in support of carsharing  in the current release candidate, [v2.3-RC2](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.3-RC2/gbfs.md)

As described in the [GBFS governance](../participate/process),
when changes are made to the specification, the changes are placed into Release Candidate (RC) status. The changes remain in RC status pending implementation.

* **Implementation requirements are that at least 1 producer and 1 consumer implement the changes.**
* **The implementors MUST be stakeholders other than The Advocate (who opened the PR).**
* **Once implemented successfully, the change is merged into an official current release.**

## Governance Process

GBFS is an open specification, developed and maintained by the community of producers and consumers of GBFS data.
The specification is not fixed or unchangeable. As the shared mobility industry evolves, it is expected that the specification will be extended by the GBFS community to include new features and capabilities over time. If you are new to engaging with the community on this repository, firstly welcome! Please identify which organization you represent when posting.
