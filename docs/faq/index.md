# What is GBFS?
The General BIkeshare Feed Specification, or GBFS, is an open data standard for shared mobility information, developed  through a consensus-based process on GitHub. GBFS enables the exchange of information in a way that ensures all parties agree on what the information represents. You can think of it like a dictionary, where each term has a definition and a set of rules for how it can be used. GBFS is a real-time data specification. It describes the current status of a mobility system at this point in time. GBFS does not support, and is not intended for historical data such as trip or maintenance records.
