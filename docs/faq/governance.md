# Governance and Change Process

**How is the specification updated?**

GBFS is an open source project developed under a consensus-based governance model. Contributors come from across the shared mobility industry, public sector, civic technology and elsewhere. Proposals for changes or additions to the specification are made through Pull Requests. Once the community has had adequate time to comment and iterate on a proposal, the proposal is put to a vote. If the proposal passes, it becomes part of a release candidate. When the release candidate has been successfully implemented in a public data set, it becomes an official release. The complete governance and change process can be found [here](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs#governance--overview-of-the-change-process).

<br>**How can I propose a change to the specification?**

If you are interested in proposing a modification, you can do so at the GBFS GitHub repo. If you do not have the solution to the problem and would like to start a discussion, we recommend you [open an issue](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/issues). If you have  a solution and would like to propose a change, please [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pulls).
