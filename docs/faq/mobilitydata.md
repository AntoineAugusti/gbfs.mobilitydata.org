<br>**What does it mean to be a MobilityData member?**

MobilityData has two membership types:

- **Core Member**: Core Members are voting members, who have the opportunity to join any working group, an invitation to send up to two representatives to any of our workshops with no fee, early access to new tools and services (exclusive access for the first three months), a stronger influence on our roadmap, and recognition on MobilityData’s website as a Core Member.

- **Regular Member**: Regular Members are non-voting members who receive updates on MobilityData’s projects, an invitation for one representative to attend one MobilityData workshop each year, occasional invitations to selected working groups and discussions, and recognition on MobilityData’s website as a Regular Member.

For more information check out [MobilityData's website](https://mobilitydata.org/members/){target=_blank}.
