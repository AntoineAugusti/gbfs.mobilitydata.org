# GitHub

**What is GitHub?**

GitHub is a website and service that allows people to work collaboratively on software and other projects. GitHub provides discussion forums and supports version control, which is an important part of managing and storing versions of a software project.

<br>**What is a repository?**

A repository, often called a “repo”, is a place where all of a project's documents and versions are stored. 

<br>**What is a GitHub issue?**

An issue on GitHub is a place for discussion. Anyone can open an issue to spark conversation about the specification, be it a direction you would like to see the spec take, or a problem you are experiencing in using the specification. 

<br>**What is a GitHub pull request?**

A pull request is a request to change the specification. Anyone can open a pull request and open the floor to comments and discussion. Pull requests are then voted on to see whether or not they should be merged into the specification.
