# Glossary

* **API** - An API (Application Program Interface) communicates with two applications. A common analogy for explaining an API is to think of a restaurant; you are one “system”, and the kitchen is another. An intermediary is needed to communicate what you want the kitchen to do for you. That intermediary, in this case the server, is the equivalent of an API. 

* **API endpoint** - An API endpoint is the specific digital location where requests for information are sent by one program and where the resource lives.

* **Consumer** - A consumer is someone who is using GBFS data. Examples of GBFS consumers are trip planning applications, researchers and regulators.

* **Deeplink** - A deeplink is a link that takes you to specific content rather than a general homepage. In the context of GBFS, a deeplink would take you to the rental page for that specific vehicle or station, rather than the system’s homepage. 

* **Geofencing** - A geofence is a virtual boundary that defines a geographic area.  When a shared mobility vehicle enters or exits a geofenced area, events can be triggered, for example a push notification can be sent to a user’s phone. Geofencing may be used to delineate pick up and drop off zones, no-ride zones, speed limit zones, equity zones, etc.

* **Provider** - A producer is the entity that is publishing GBFS, most often the system operator.

* **Station** - A station is a location where shared mobility vehicles are made available for rent. Stations may include physical infrastructure like rental kiosks, docks or racks, or they may be virtual, delineated by pavement markings. 

* **System** - A system is the entirety of the shared mobility service from a single provider.  Systems can be made up of docking stations, vehicles, and other infrastructure, and are typically limited to the local geography in which they operate. 

* **Vehicle** - A system’s fleet is made up of individual vehicles. Some systems may have multiple vehicle types, whereas others may only have one. Examples of shared mobility vehicles are bikes, ebikes, scooters, and mopeds.
