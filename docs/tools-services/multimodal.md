# Other Multimodal Data Formats

- [Alliance for Parking Data Standards (APDS)](https://www.allianceforparkingdatastandards.org/){target=_blank}: Formed by the [International Parking Institute](https://www.parking.org/){target=_blank}, the [British Parking Association](http://www.britishparking.co.uk/){target=_blank}, and the [European Parking Association](http://www.europeanparking.eu/){target=_blank}, APDS is a not-for-profit organization with the mission to develop, promote, manage, and maintain a uniform global standard that will allow organizations to share parking data across platforms worldwide. 

- [City Data Standard - Mobility](https://www.polisnetwork.eu/news/dutch-cities-develop-new-mobility-data-standard/){target=_blank}: An open data standard for data exchange between cities and shared mobility operators.

- [Data Standards and Guidance for Transportation Planning and Traffic Operations](https://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=4543){target=_blank}: Standards and/or guidance to be used and adopted by the transportation community collecting, managing, an sharing status and real-time data for transportation planning and operations. 

- [Dyno-Demand](https://github.com/osplanning-data-standards/dyno-demand){target=_blank}: A GTFS-based travel demand data format focusing on individual passenger demand suitable for dynamic network modelling developed by [San Francisco County Transportation Authority](https://www.sfcta.org/){target=_blank}, LMZ LLC, and [Urban Labs LLC](http://urbanlabs.io/){target=_blank}. 

- [Dyno-Path](https://github.com/osplanning-data-standards/dyno-path){target=_blank}: ([Under development](https://github.com/osplanning-data-standards/GTFS-PLUS/pull/52#issuecomment-331231000){target=_blank}) Data from individual passenger trajectories. 

- [General Transit Feed Specification](https://gtfs.org/){target=_blank}: A GTFS feed is a group of text files that contains infrequently changing transit data, like stops, routes, trips, and other schedule data. Transit agencies typically update their GTFS feed every few months. 

- [General Travel Network Specification](https://zephyrtransport.org/trb17projects/7-general-travel-network-specification/){target=_blank}: A planned data specification for sharing travel demand model networks. 

- [Managed and Tolled Lanes Feed Specification (MTLFS)](https://github.com/vta/Managed-and-Tolled-Lanes-Feed-Specification){target=_blank}: Proposal for a schema that comprises of MTLFS and defined the field used in all of those files developed by [Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority](https://www.vta.org/){target=_blank}. 

- [Mobility as a Service API](http://maas-api.org/){target=_blank}: A set of open documents and test suite that defines a MaaS-compatible API. 

- [Mobility Data Specification](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification){target=_blank}: A project of the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/){target=_blank} (OMF), MDS is a set of open source APIs focused on dockless shared mobility. Inspired by projects like GTFS and GBFS, the goals of MDS are to provide a standardized way for municipalities or other regulatory agencies to regulate operators and enforce policy, and ingest, compare and analyze data from mobility service providers, and to give municipalities the ability to express regulation in machine-readable formats. 

- [NeTex](https://netex-cen.eu/){target=_blank}: A general purpose XML format designed for the exchange of complex static transport data among distributed systems managed by the [CEN standards process](https://www.cencenelec.eu/){target=_blank}. 

- [SAE Shared Mobility](https://www.sae.org/shared-mobility/){target=_blank}: Working on a data standard for carshare and transportation network companies/rideshare.

- [Transactional Data Specifications for Transportation Planning and Traffic Operations](https://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=4120){target=_blank}: Technical specifications for transactional data for entities involved in the provision of demand-responsive transportation. 

- [Transit ITS Data Exchange Specification (TIDES) Project](https://groups.google.com/g/tidesproject){target=_blank}: A proposed effort to create standard data structures, APIs, and data management tools for historical transit ITS data including AVL, APC, and AFC Data.
